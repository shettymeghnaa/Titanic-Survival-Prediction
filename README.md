# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques. It leverages passenger data such as age, gender, ticket class, and more to make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about Titanic passengers, including:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Fare paid for the ticket
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Task Objectives
1. **Preprocess the dataset**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.
2. **Train a Machine Learning Model**: Implement models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost.
3. **Evaluate Performance**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model.
4. **Make Predictions**: Generate survival predictions for new passenger data.

Evaluation Criteria
Functionality: How well the model predicts survival.

Code Quality: Clean, well-structured, and commented code.

Performance: Accuracy and efficiency of the trained model.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.

Key insights from the dataset:

Women had a higher survival rate than men.

Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.

Younger passengers had a better chance of survival.

Future Improvements
Tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

Test additional machine learning models.

Use deep learning for better predictions.
